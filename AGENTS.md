# Repository Guidelines
This is a starter repo for applications that use a very oppiniated stack - React 19 + Tailwind 4 for frontend, .Net 9 for backend with minimal APIs, Postgres DB, FormFeeder to handle static forms, MailJet for emails, Identity.Base for identity and user management

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- `docs/` contains subfolders for planning, specs, guides, sprints, audits, runbooks, and reference material (see `docs/README.md`).

## Non-Negotiable Rules
- **NEVER DELETE FILES YOU DID NOT CREATE OR MODIFY IN THIS SESSION.** If you find an unexpected file or change, stop and ask for guidance instead of removing it.
- Favor minimal, well-scoped edits; leave unrelated files untouched.
- Capture assumptions and uncertainties in your hand-off notes so follow-up work is easy.
